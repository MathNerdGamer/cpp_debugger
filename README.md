# C++ Debugger (joke)

This is a ["printf debugger"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging#Techniques:~:text=Print%20debugging%20or,function%20in%20C.) written in C++ using preprocessor macros to implement basic reflection that I wrote mostly as a joke in 2018. I'm a bit late to make this an April Fool's repository, but it's still April, so why not?
